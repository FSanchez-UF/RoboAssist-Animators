# RoboAssist-Animators
Our animation project for CAP3034 is centered around a robot assisting an elderly person. The RoboAssist Animators team aims to create an engaging and heartwarming animation that showcases the benefits of technology in helping seniors maintain their independence and quality of life. Through this project, we hope to inspire viewers to embrace technology as a tool to support and enhance the lives of older adults.
